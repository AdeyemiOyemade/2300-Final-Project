## Contract Terms

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
- We want to create a good website that thoroughly displays the skills we learned in this class.
- Finish this project without any tension and limited disagreement in our group
- Getting our specific tasks done by the agreed upon time and doing them to the best of our abilities
- Do 'A' quality work
- Effectively communicate throughout this process

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

- Respect one another
- Commit to what we say we would do
- communicate when trying to make changes to someone elses code


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
through facebook messenger, and in person.  as needed, just keeping updated on what we're working on and what we need to do next.


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
email + in person meetings


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
main point of contact for client -- communicates with them, sets up meetings, keeps them updated and gets feedback
tester - does everything in their power to find bugs and break the website
meeting organizer - finds times that work for everyone and reserves library rooms if necessary


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

We will just text each other to see what is going on. We want to have a trusting work enviroment, so hopefully check-ups are enough to get everyone to do their own work.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
Talk out the issue until we find common ground.  Be respecful and open-minded to other people's ideas even if you don't agree.  If two people absolutely cannot agree, we can do a casual vote but this should be avoided.


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
- Whenever we feel like a group member is not participating as effectively as they should, we will revisit the contract and determine if they are violating the contract
- All group members will revisit the contract if it is deemed necessary, and we will make an informed decision based off of what was written here in the contract

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

- We will get food at one meeting
- High fives when things go well
- Always provide mutual support so that each member feels comfortable and happy being in the group



## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
