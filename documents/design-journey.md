## Client Description

Cornell Welcomes Refugees
- CWR is an organization that is made up of Cornell students who want to provide a welcoming and fair environment for refugees and immigrants that attend Cornell or are hoping to attend to Cornell. They hope that they can make Cornell a welcoming school and home for refugees in a time of global need.
- They want to have a website that most represents a non-profit website, just without the ability to donate to them.  Meaning, they want a website that gives them a platform and a way to outsource info on their organization and their mission.
- Their key goals for this site are to connect the greater Cornell community with their cause, connect their members and outside website users to national organizations working with the same mission, and to make the site a source of information and advertising about their organization to the Cornell community (e.g., info on their organization like EBoard, upcoming events, mission statements, news and updates, etc.)

Used http://www.isucornell.com as a reference for what they would like the styling and content to look like
Login, contact, posting about events
Goals: “platform to spread our information”
> connecting wider Cornell community
> connecting people to other national organizations
> spreading information about events we are having,
> trying to create scholarships for refugees at Cornell so they want a platform to advertise that
Content Ideas:
> Who we are
> Who is on our team
> What our organization does
> How people can get involved
> What our current projects are
> Videos
> Timeline page 2017-2018-2019 (reference ISU events page)
> Universal username and password for their admins to add content to their events page for example


## Purpose & Content

The main purpose of this website is to connect the greater Cornell community with the cause of Cornell Welcomes Refugees. The site will serve as a source of information about their organization, as well as connect people with resources about refugees. This will include links to national organizations, information about their members, and lists of events, among other things. This site will also help CWR advertise their clubs and mission.

## Target Audience(s)

One target audience is people interested in contributing to the mission of Cornell Welcomes Refugees. They would interact with the website by using it to learn more about resources that they can use, as well as getting contacting information for people in the organization, and hearing about relevant events that they can get involved in.

Another target audience is people who are interested in joining Cornell Welcomes Refugees. They will be able to access the website from the Facebook page or word of mouth. They can use this page to join CWR by submitting their email to join the list serv, keeping up with upcoming events on the events page, and using the stats and stories pages to learn more about why this cause matters.

A final target audience is the administrators of CornelL Welcomes Refugees. They will use this website to update the information about their club. They can login to the administrative features using the login link in the footer, and then an additional Admin page will appear in the navigation bar. Here, they can add and delete people on the Teams page, and add and delete events on the Events page.

 ![Card Sort](cardsort.JPG)

We came up with our card sorting by looking at the content sheet that our client supplied to us, as well as the meeting minutes from our in-person meeting. From here, we were able to come up with bigger categories that turned into each page, and added the subcontent based on the specfiic paragraphs, photos, and desired functionalities they supplied to us. The process was very free-flowing and open to all ideas.


## Interactivity

* Navigation Highlight - clicking on a page will add a shade and indicator around the page's name.
- PHP element: setting a variable based on the current page.
- Target audience: this allows users of the website to know what page they are in for ease of navigation.

* Hovering, Teams Page - The Team page will be an interactive photo gallery. The images will have a hovering feature where they will have a black and white overlay. The user will be able to click on the image of that person to learn more about them.
  - PHP element: Click yields a get query which leads to another page the uses SQL to fill in that person's information.
  - Target audience: people interest in the club can learn about the members.

* Edit profile, Profile Page - Clicking on an image on the Team page will lead to a profile page of one person. The user will see a button where they can edit the profile if they are logged in.
  - PHP element: checks if they are logged in, interactive form with variables.
  - Target audience: administrators of the club can keep the page up to date.

* Hovering, Stories Page - The Stories page will be an interactive photo gallery. The images will have a hovering feature where they will have a greyish overlay with the name of the refugee, the country, and a blurb about their experience. It will prompt the user to click to learn more.
  - PHP element: Click will send the user to a page where the image will be displayed and the story of the person will be displayed. Accessing data from the database through the get element, and information from the database will be rendered through the connection.
  - Target audience: people interested in getting involved in the mission will be able to become informed.

* Drop downs, Resources and Around the World - There will be drop downs on these two pages.
  - PHP element: if/else statement
  - Target audience: people trying to learn more can do so without having the page be too clutted.

* Login: A login function will be at the footer of the page. It is not at the top is because it is not meant for the audience but for the administrators, so it's not meant to be in plain sight. When an administrator is logged in a new paged will be rendered in the navigation bar so that the admin will be able to add and delete members, and events.
  - PHP element: form with variables and SQL queries.
  - Target audience: administrators can keep the website up to date.

* Get Involved: Form to allow people to submit the username and password and sign up for the listserv.
  - PHP element: form with variables and SQL queries.
  - Target audience: people try to join and learn more can do so.

* Admin Page: The admin page has forms to allow the administrators to delete/add events and members.
  - PHP element: forms and validation. SQL queries.
  - Target audience: administrators can keep the website up to date.

## Iterated Design

We then met with Cornell Welcomes Refugees and they told us what elements they liked and didn't like. We used this to make an intermediate design in order to get started with our implementations.
![Home](intermediate_home.JPG)
![Team](intermediate_team.JPG)
![Events](intermediate_events.JPG)
![Stories](intermediate_stories.JPG)
![Around The World](intermediate_around_the_world.JPG)
![Get Involved](intermediate_get_involved.JPG)
![Admin](intermediate_admin.JPG)
![Login](intermediate_login.JPG)

- change name of statistics page to Around the World
- combine stories and around the world into one link on the nav bar and call it Learn.  When you hover over learn, it drops down into the two options.
- add social media links to the footer instead of having them stick out on their page.
- Teams page will have a name change, TBD, because they do not know exactly who will be on the "Team" page yet
- We are going to make the eboard page more like a photo gallery
- going to make the around the world page a scroll format
- add a link to the admin login in the footer
- make sure that the get involved form doesn't have anything related to being a Cornell student (year, netID labels) so that members of the outside community can join as well


## Evaluate your Design

We selected Abby because she is most unlike our group. This will give us greater insight into things we may have not already considered. While our team has a 50/50 gender split, we are all comfortable and knowledge about technology and try new things. Her more cautious attitude will help us consider the accessibility of our website.

### Cognitive Walkthrough

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

**Task name: Sign up for the CWR listserve**
**Subgoal # 1 : Go to signup page**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no:  Maybe
    - Why? She may not realize that a different page exists for her to do this.
    **Action #1: click on the "get involved" page in the navigation bar.**
      - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
        - Yes, maybe or no: Maybe
        - Why? She may not know that Get Involved is the correct page that will allow her to submit her email to the listserv. She may click around a bit before getting to the right page, and may get discouraged.

      - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
        - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
        - Why? The title of the main body of the page is "Join Our Listserv!" so she will be validated that she made the correct action.

**Subgoal # 2: fill out the get involved form**
- Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
  - Yes, maybe or no:  Yes
  - Why? She will see the title "Join Our Listserv!". Based on Abby's experience, this is enough information for her to know that she has gotten to the right form and will fill it out. Abby is keen on accomplishing the goals and the title will validate her.

  **Action #1: find the form to fill out**
    - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
      - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
      - Why? The form is right below "Join Our Listserv!" which validates her.

    - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
      - Yes, maybe or no: Maybe
      - Why? She will not know until she submits the form and gets feedback.

    **Action #2: fill out the name section**
    - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
      - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
      - Why? The label is clear and Abby has used software in the past.

    - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?

    **Action #1: click on the "team" page in the navigation bar**
      - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
        - Yes, maybe or no: Maybe
        - Why? Abby is not familiar with our website and may not know that "Team" is associated with the members of the executive board of CWR. She may be skeptical of whether or not this is the right place to go. She may click around a bit and get discouraged.

      - Why? She will find the person she is looking for.
  **Action #2: locate the member**
    - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
      - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
      - Why? She has used software before and will know once she sees who she is looking for because there isn't an overwhelming amount of information and it will validate her.

      - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
      - Why? She will see the person and it will validate her.

  **Action #3: click on the member**
    - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
      - Yes, maybe or no: Maybe
      - Why? She may not know that clicking will get her to the right information.

    - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
      - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
      - Why? She will be taken to a page with more information.


### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How will you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be **very** thorough and thoughtful.]

We found a few issues with our design after going through the Cognitive Walk-through.

First, the user may not know that "Get Involved" is the correct page to go to in order to join the Listserv. Get Involved could mean a lot of things to a lot of people, and if the navigation bar is overwhelming, then the person might get discouraged when trying to figure out if they can join the Listserv. To address this, we are going make sure that our navigation bar is not cluttered and that all of the other labels on the navigation bar would not suggest that there could be any doubt about the where to go in order to join the listserv. We are glad to have realized this as we want Cornell Welcomes Refugees to have an easy time getting members to join, and to fulfill the target audience's needs for all types of audience members.

Second, the user may not be able to figure out that more information about a person is accessible via the team page. This was evident as we realized that when Abby got to the Team page, if she knew to get there, she may not know that more information is available by clicking. We realized two things that could help inform our design process. First, like mentioned above, we are going to make sure that the navigation bar is completely clear and that a user would have no question about whether or not they needed to try a different page. This is so that no user gets discouraged and is unsucessful in using the website. We want everyone to have a good, smooth experience, Second, we realized that we need to make it obvious that the images of the people are clickable. We decided to implement hovering. Mousing over the images greys it out, which indicates that they are clickable. The user will be curious and proceed, thus finding more information.

We are satisfied that we chose Abby for our Cognitive Walk-through as we may not have otherwise uncovered these issues. This process yielded good discussion about making sure that the needs of our client and target audience is satisified for all types of users.

- we moved the facebook link to the footer
- we added appropriate citations
- we created drop downs on the informational pages so that the user does not get overwhelmed
- we made the team page have just pictures, so that when they click they get to a new page with more information about the team
- we made the stories more centered around pictures and short blurbs for each person side by side
- we called the "stats" page "Around the World" per the client's request
- we made a login page instead of having it in the footer
- we made more minimalist style choices because of our brainstorming process and after completing the Cognitive Walk-through

## Issues & Challenges

* We had a hard time getting content from the client. They did not respond to our GroupMe messages and they would get frustrated with us becuase they thought we should have been working on the design when we really just needed the content. We final came to an agreement about them supplying us with content and they sent us a lot at once.
* It took us a while to finalize what kind of design we wanted. Solving this issue took a lot of iteration, but we got there.
* We had a hard time figuring out interactivity. It was sparse at first. After getting feedback from other teams, and seeing other websites, we got a lot of ideas.

--- <!-- ^^^ Milestone 3; vvv FINAL SUBMISSION-->

## Final Notes to the Clients

We were unable to find a way to connect the listserv to the GetInvolved page, but we will find a way to do so after the submission of our project.

We were unable to meet with our main point of contact to get feedback on the final design because we was out of town and busy when we could, so we are happy to do so at your earliest convenience.

## Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

Our website does a really great job of having a ton of valuable information and resources without looking too wordy, cluttered, or confusing. We have a very minimalist style, yet the website is rich with information. The website is also very customizable, and it is easily customizble through the admin functionality, even for someone who does not know anything about PHP/HTML/CSS/SQL.

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]

We would like to work with the client in the future to launch this website; they are very passionate about this and we want the website to go live.

We also would like to meet with them in order to get feedback on the design. We were unable to do so as the main point of contact was out of town when we were able to meet.

Lastly, we want to find a way to make the GetInvolved page actually add people to the listserv.

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]

We have nothing to add-- we had a great time working on this, thank you so much!
